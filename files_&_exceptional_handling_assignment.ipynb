        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " - Interpreted languages (like Python) run code line-by-line using an interpreter.\n",
        "Compiled languages (like C++) convert the whole code to machine language before running it.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python ?\n",
        " - Exception handling is a way to handle errors during program execution using try, except, finally, and raise.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The finally block always runs, even if an error occurs. It's used to clean up resources like closing files or connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        " - Logging records messages about a program's execution (info, warning, error, etc.) for debugging or tracking purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - __del__ is a destructor method. It is called when an object is deleted to free up resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " - import module imports the whole module.\n",
        "from module import func imports only a specific function/class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " - Use multiple except blocks or combine exceptions like: except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " - It's mostly beneficial. The only challenge might be less control if you need to keep the file open across blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " - Multithreading runs threads within the same process (good for I/O tasks).\n",
        "Multiprocessing runs separate processes (better for CPU-bound tasks).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - Helps in debugging, error tracking, and understanding the program flow    without printing everything to the console.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Python automatically handles memory using reference counting and garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Use try block to write risky code, except to catch errors, finally for cleanup, and optionally else if no error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python ?\n",
        " - It helps to avoid memory leaks and improves performance by freeing unused memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " - try runs the code that might cause an error.\n",
        "except handles the error if it occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " - It removes objects that are no longer used using reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n",
        " - else runs code only if the try block doesnt raise an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " - DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        " - os.fork() is Unix-specific and manually creates a child process.\n",
        "multiprocessing is cross-platform and easier to use with better control.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n",
        " - It frees system resources and ensures data is properly written.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        " - read() reads the whole file content.\n",
        "readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for\n",
        " - It's used to track events during program execution for debugging or monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        " - It helps interact with the operating system, like renaming, deleting files, or navigating directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Issues like circular references, memory leaks, and improper object lifecycle can affect memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        " - Use the raise keyword, like: raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",

        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
